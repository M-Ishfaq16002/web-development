   <p>Imagine each paragraph as <b> having three general layers </b> of text. The core content is in the middle.<br> It includes all the evidence <u>you need to make the point. </u> However, this evidence needs to be introduced <em>by a topic </em> sentence in some way or your readers don't know what to do with all the evidence you have given them. <i> Therefore, the beginning </i>of the paragraph explains the controlling idea of the paragraph. The last part of the paragraph tells the reader how the <strong> relates to the broader argument </strong> and often provides a transition to the next idea. Once you have mastered the use of topic sentences, you may decide that the topic sentence for a particular paragraph really should not be the first sentence of the paragraph.  </p>
